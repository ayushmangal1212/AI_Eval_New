# Merge Summary: eval.py + eval_new.py → eval_final.py

## Overview
Successfully merged unique features from `eval.py` and `eval_new.py` into `eval_final.py`.

## File Statistics
- **eval.py**: 1,399 lines (adaptive complexity + code IDE features)
- **eval_new.py**: 1,603 lines (admin dashboard + enhanced SSL)
- **eval_final.py**: 1,727 lines (complete merged version)

## Features from eval.py (Complexity & IDE)

### 1. Adaptive Complexity System
- **Constants Added**:
  - `CORRECT_SCORE_THRESHOLD = 16` (score >= 16 is considered good)
  - `MAX_COMPLEXITY = 5`
  - `MIN_COMPLEXITY = 1`

- **Session State**:
  - Added `complexity_level` (initialized to `MIN_COMPLEXITY`)

- **Dynamic Question Difficulty**:
  - `build_question_prompt()` now accepts `complexity` parameter
  - Complexity instruction added to LLM prompt: "Difficulty Level: X/5 (1=basic, 5=expert)"
  - `gen_question()` passes complexity to prompt generation

- **Complexity Adjustment Logic**:
  - After evaluation, if `score >= CORRECT_SCORE_THRESHOLD`:
    - Increases `complexity_level` for next question (capped at MAX_COMPLEXITY)
  - If score < threshold:
    - Keeps same complexity level

### 2. Code IDE with Ace Editor
- **Function Added**: `create_code_ide_html(language, key)`
  - Embedded Ace Editor (loaded via CDN)
  - Multi-language support: Python, JavaScript, Java, C, C++, Go, Ruby
  - Language-to-mode mapping for proper syntax highlighting
  - **Save-to-Answer Button**: 
    - Uses React-friendly value setter (`Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor`)
    - Triggers native input/change events for Streamlit compatibility
  - **Clear Button**: Resets editor content

- **UI Integration**:
  - Language selector dropdown for coding questions
  - IDE rendered above textarea when `current_is_coding = True`
  - Textarea remains as fallback/final submission field

## Features from eval_new.py (Admin & Infrastructure)

### 1. Admin Dashboard
- **Credentials**:
  - `ADMIN_USERNAME` (env var, default: "admin")
  - `ADMIN_PASSWORD` (env var, default: "Admin@123")

- **Session State**:
  - `admin_logged_in`
  - `admin_username`

- **Features**:
  - Admin login tab in main interface
  - User management dashboard
  - Evaluation history viewing
  - CSV export for evaluation data
  - User attempt management (view/reset)
  - Role-specific attempt limits

### 2. Enhanced SSL/TLS Handling
- **Insecure Mode** (development only):
  - `ALLOW_INSECURE_LLM` env var support
  - Disables TLS verification when set (with warning)

- **Certificate Fallback**:
  - Checks if `SSL_CERT_FILE` is readable
  - Falls back to `certifi.where()` if system cert is inaccessible
  - Handles PermissionError gracefully

- **Support for Custom CA**:
  - Can use `combined_ca.pem` for private certificate authorities
  - Configurable via `SSL_CERT_FILE` environment variable

### 3. Data Export (CSV)
- **Functions Added**:
  - `eval_history_to_csv_for_user(username)`: Single user export
  - `eval_history_to_csv_all()`: All users export

- **CSV Includes**:
  - Username, date, role, scores, percentages
  - Time taken per evaluation
  - Question-by-question breakdown with feedback

### 4. Logging Infrastructure
- Enhanced error logging throughout
- Better exception handling with specific error messages

## Additional Features Already in Both Files
- Navigation persistence (`nav_choice` session state)
- Voice mode with Web Speech API
- Audio answer support
- Client-side timers (total interview + per-question)
- Auto-submit on timeout
- Question uniqueness checking (prevents duplicates)
- 5-question evaluation (Questions 3 & 5 are coding)

## Merge Strategy Used
1. **Base**: Started with `eval_new.py` (has more infrastructure)
2. **Added from eval.py**:
   - Complexity constants and session state
   - `create_code_ide_html()` function
   - Complexity parameter in `build_question_prompt()`
   - Complexity parameter in `gen_question()`
   - Updated all `gen_question()` call sites to pass complexity
   - Complexity adjustment logic after evaluation
   - IDE rendering in answer form with language selector

## Verification
- ✅ No syntax errors
- ✅ All session state variables initialized
- ✅ Complexity tracking functional
- ✅ IDE with multi-language support
- ✅ Admin dashboard preserved
- ✅ Enhanced SSL handling preserved
- ✅ CSV export functionality intact

## Usage Notes

### For Adaptive Complexity:
- Questions start at difficulty level 1
- Each correct answer (score >= 16/20) increases difficulty
- Maximum difficulty is 5
- Difficulty affects LLM prompt to generate harder questions

### For Code IDE:
- Available only for coding questions (Questions 3 & 5)
- Select programming language from dropdown
- Write code in Ace editor OR paste in textarea
- Click "Save to Answer" to transfer IDE code to submission field
- Submit as normal

### For Admin Access:
1. Go to "Admin" tab on login page
2. Use credentials (default: admin/Admin@123)
3. View all users, evaluations, export data
4. Manage attempt limits per role

### Environment Variables:
- `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`: API key for LLM
- `ADMIN_USERNAME`: Admin login (default: "admin")
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD`: Admin password (default: "Admin@123")
- `SSL_CERT_FILE`: Custom CA certificate path (optional)
- `ALLOW_INSECURE_LLM`: Set to "true" to disable TLS verification (dev only)

## Next Steps
You can now use `eval_final.py` as your main application file. It combines all features:
- Adaptive difficulty based on candidate performance
- Professional code editor for coding challenges
- Complete admin dashboard for user and evaluation management
- Robust SSL/TLS handling for corporate environments
- CSV export for evaluation analytics

To run: `streamlit run eval_final.py`
